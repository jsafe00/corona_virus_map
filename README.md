This is a map app I made to track the spread of COVID19 around the world. I used a repo from colbyfayock (https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet) to bootstrap the app by using Leaflet as a map outline. I added some api calls from https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/. I'm still learning reactjs. Feel free to enhance this.

The following is pulled from colbyfayock's README, with the change of my repo instead of his.
